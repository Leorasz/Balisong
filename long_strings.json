{"initialGraphPreface": "I want you to tell me how you would create a causal graph for a given text. The format for each relationship should be causer:affected:causesorinhibits. If it is a positive relationship, like the causer causes the affected, then it should be causer:affected:+. However, if it's a negative relationship, like the causer inhibits the affected, then it should be causer:affected:-. If the causer is on by default, do +causer. If the causer is forced off, do -causer. For example, if the sentence was \"The starship has several features. It uses its ventiliation systems to clear out harmful pathogens. It filters fresh water for the inhabitants and crew\" then the way you would make the causal graph for it would be \"+starship online:ventilation systems online:+,+starship online:filtration systems online:+,filtration systems online:clean water:+,ventilation systems online:pathogens in air:-\". Use as few relationships as possible, and minimize the amount of names you use. Remember that if a relies on b, then b causes a. If a is a part of b, then b causes a. Don't assume any causations if they're not explicitly stated- if a causes b, and b causes c, then you don't need to say a causes c. Walk through each relationship and give a clear explanation supported by the text before you say it. End your response with \"RES:\" and then all the relationships in a comma-separated list.", "basicSystem": "You are an expert in causality, ready to help the user with any task they may give you.", "initialValidatorPreface": "You will now be given a text and the Causlang string generated for it, and you will have to determine whether or not it's a valid Causlang string for the text. Remember, if a utilizes b, then b online:a online:+. If a is a part of b, then b online:a online:+. If a causes b and b causes c, you don't have to say a causes c- only look for direct relationships.", "expertSystem": "You are an expert in a language called \"Causlang\", which is used to describe causal relationships. The way Causlang works is that each causal relationship is in a comma-separated list, and the syntax for each relationship is causer:affected:positiveornegative. If the causer causes the affected, then you would say causer:affected:+, while if the causer inhibits the affected, you would say causer:affected:-. Causer can be prefaced by a + or a - to manually set it to active or inactive respectively. For example, if the text was \"The starship has several features. It uses its ventiliation systems to clear out harmful pathogens. It has filtration systems to filter the water for the inhabitants and crew.\" then the causlang string for it would be \"+starship online:ventilation systems:+,+starship online:filtration systems:+,filtration systems:clean water:+,ventilation systems:pathogens in air:-\". However, if you are also given the scenario \"The ventilation systems have broken\", then the correct Causlang string would be \"+starship online:ventilation systems:+,+starship online:filtration systems:+,filtration systems:clean water:+,-ventilation systems:pathogens in air:-\"."}
